Code for the mash controller 

I brew beer.  I've built a recirculating heating unit to accurately control the mash temperature which the grains soak in ~150F water for an hour.  I use a raspberry pi to control the temperature.

This is code that runs that controller, using PID feedback to maintain an accurate temperature.
